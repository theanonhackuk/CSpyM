# CSpyM
I called this CSpyM (Chinese Spyware/Malware) because the other day i get knowed that for some reason my pc was working like a motorcycle when it wasnt even running 1 program so i decided to investigate in my pc and I found an ascy variant and i decided to decompile and seems its little bit fud 51/69 detections, congratulations kid.

I also notice that it as obfuscated so i deobfuscated, then decompiled and i get this shit that seams that is like a type of worm?
